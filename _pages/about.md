# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-spin fa-fw"></i> Biography #
Hello! I am a final-year PhD candidate in Machine Learning to understand Mitochondrial Disease Pathology at [Wellcome Centre for Mitochondrial Research](https://www.newcastle-mitochondria.com/) and [EPSRC CDT for Big Data](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/bigdata/), [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/). I am a member of [Newcastle AI Lab](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/nail/) led by Prof. [Stephen McGough](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/stephenmcgough.html). I am advised by Prof. [Stephen McGough](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/stephenmcgough.html), Dr. [Conor Lawless](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/conorlawless.html) and  Dr. [Amy Vincent](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/amyvincent.html).


My research focuses on applying artificial intelligence/machine learning methods to understand mitochondrial disease pathology. I work with tissue image data (Image Mass Cytometry & immunofluorescence) with an aim to automate (where possible) the process of understanding disease pathology i.e. i) Upstream Data Preparation: this include precise segmentation and curation (selecting cells with good uniform quality) of single-cells in tissue images using novel machine learning (ML) methods. ii) Downstream Data Analysis: this include using ML to classify deficient (affected by disease) cells based on multi-dimensional protein expression data. And iii) Using explainable ML profile various genetically diagnosed mitochondrial diseases based on their protein expression data.
The experience of working on these topics allowed me to develop expertise in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Explainable ML, Biomedical Image Data (IMC & Microscopy).

Prior to this I spent 8 years as a DevOps and Software Engineer, developing big data applications in cloud. This allowed me to develop expertise in Java, OpenShift , Python and various public cloud services.
